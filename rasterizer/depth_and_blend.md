## Task 4: Depth Testing and Blending

Search for: `//A1T4: Depth_Less`, `//A1T4: Blend_Add`, and `//A1T4: Blend_Over` (in `src/rasterizer/pipeline.cpp`)
Test with: `./Scotty3D --run-tests a1.task4.`
Tests provided: `tests/a1/test.a1.task4.cpp`

The way fragments generated by rasterization functions get written back to the framebuffer is controlled by the blending and depth testing state. In this task, you'll fill in a few small equations to make depth testing and blending work.

TODO: these modes can allow for many special effects -- check out scene (TODO) to see how `Blend_Add` in combination with `DepthWriteDisable` can be used to make interesting transparent structures.
